# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did nothing. Recontinued [my Free Code Camp stuff](https://www.freecodecamp.com/quswar).

**Thoughts:** I'm not good today, but committing to work is really important now. Looked for random stuff regarding full stack development. #100DaysOfCode

### Day 0: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did no work on any project, spent time learning code and continued jQuery on @freeCodeCamp. So I'll continue to call it Day0. #100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts:** I should be starting some project ASAP!
